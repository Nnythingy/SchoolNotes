1st step is to find the format of png image
89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a is the magic number

hexdump encrypted_file.png > hexdump

so take the 1st 4 bytes and xor with the magic number, and this will get the key
5089474e0a0d0a1a XOR 60ed223e3a696f6a = d0ped0pe

since supposed to be 8950..., had to swap the endianness

89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a XOR ed 60 3e 22 69 3a 6a 6f

playing on cyberchef gets me the key d0ped0pe
place the file into cyberchef and using the key to perform XOR operation

save the file and open
