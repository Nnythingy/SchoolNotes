# Bug Category: Parameter Pollution

# The logic of the case01.php is: 
# 1. in line 11, the php code requires both payee and sum parameters in the GET request
# 2. in line 21, there is a check if either of the payee or sum parameter is not the expected string, then the flag will be printed out.

# Exploit: 
# We can see that there is no control on the parameters which can be sent in by the users. Hence any GET request with the parameters both in the URL but with different values would thus print out the flag on the website.
