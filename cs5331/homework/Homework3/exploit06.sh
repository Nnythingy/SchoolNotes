# Bug Category: Remote Code Execution

# The logic of the case06.php is: 
# 1. line 14 checks if a POST request is sent with the parameter 'cmd_url'. If it is, the value of cmd_url will be sent in shell_exec()
# 2. shell_exec() in line 19 will then run value of cmd_url as a command for the server to run in its shell. the output will then be echo out as per line 21
# 3. if nothing is sent, the default value will be set to netstat -an as per line 9

# Exploit: 
# to exploit this, we just need to send cat /etc/passwd as the value of cmd_url in a POST request
