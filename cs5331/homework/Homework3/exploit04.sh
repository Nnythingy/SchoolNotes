# Bug Category: Unvalidated Redirect

# The logic of the case04.php is: 
# 1. in line 13, the parameter 'redirect' is being checked if it is being sent via a GET request.
# 2. if it is sent, then in line 15, using the HTTP location header, it will redirect to the specified url that is the value of the redirect parameter
# 3. in the normal code, the redirect function will just redirect to an existing php file called case04-2.php if the redirect parameter is not set

# Exploit: 
# to exploit this, we just need to set https://www.google.com to redirect the page to google.com using the Location header.
