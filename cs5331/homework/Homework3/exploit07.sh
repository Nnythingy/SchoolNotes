# Bug Category: Execution after Redirect

# The logic of the case07.php is: 
# 1. in case07.php line 5, they will redirect immediately to case07-1.php
# 2. however, there is also more html code after the php code above, which is the flag value.

# Exploit: 
# To exploit this, there is a need to find a browser that does not follow the redirect. Using python requests, we can just set allow-redirect to false. Hence it will not follow the HTTP 302 code and redirect to case07-1.php and print out the flag as text.
