# Bug Category: PHP Injection

# The logic of the case05.php is: 
# 1. line 13 allows the user to submit a form. Then the user input will be set under the 'something' name
# 2. this will then be sent as a GET request with the parameter 'something' and the attached value of the user's input.
# 3. in line 22, the website will then echo the eval of 'echo (value of something)'. This means it will run echo again on the user's input.

# Exploit: 
# to exploit this, we need to find a command which can be run by eval. In this case, we can simply put in the PHP variable $flag as the value to the parameter something. eval will hence run 'echo $flag', printing out the value of the php variable flag directly.
