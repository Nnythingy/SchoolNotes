# Bug Category: Local File Inclusion

# The logic of the case03.php is: 
# 1. the user will choose a language from the drop down option
# 2. this will call loadAnotherLang() with the value of the parameter LANG
# 3. in line 37, when sending a POST request to case03.php, if there is a value for the parameter LANG, then try to include the file from includes/value_of_LANG.php and write that data on the page in line 13
# 4. for example, when the user chooses French option, this will post to the website with the value 'fr' to the parameter LANG. This will then include the file includes/fr.php to then write the file contents to the webpage.

# Exploit: 
# by posting the value ../lfi.txt as the value of LANG. This will include the file includes../lfi.txt.php which contains the flag. Since the includes command will choose a file in the includes directory, we need to go back 1 directory with ../ and choose the file lfi.txt to write the flag onto the webpage
