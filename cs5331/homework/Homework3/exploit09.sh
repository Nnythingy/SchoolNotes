# Bug Category: CSRF predictable token

# The logic of the case09.php is: 
# 1. the csrf token is stored in the php variable $csrfToken line 7.
# 2. line 8 and 9 would check if the POST request contains a data parameter and a csrf_token parameter. The csrf token must also have a specific value of wkjdb-iouer-234k3-wklu3k
# 3. Only after the checks have passed, with the correct csrf token, then the value in the data parameter will be echoed onto the site

# Exploit: 
# to exploit this, we just need to copy this csrf token and submit it along with the data that we want in the POST request. The python script will take an input, and then send that message as the data.
