# Bug Category: Reflected XSS

# The logic of the case08.php is: 
# 1. the flag is being stored as a cookie with the name value pair as Flag : S9vjABuASDF9Ddf
# 2. in line 16, there is a check if a parameter name exists from a GET request.
# 3. in line 18, the value of that parameter will be set under the variable $name
# 4. moreover, there is a sanitisation function of a string replace of '<script>' to '', essentially removing the <script> tag from the value in the parameter name.
# 5. this value would then be printed out onto the website after Hello (value)

# Exploit: 
# to exploit and write the cookie onto the website, we need to allow the script tags to run document.write(document.cookie) onto the site. Hence to pass the sanitisation, we can write <scri<script>pt>, this will remove the intact <script> and leave the 2 parts <scri and pt>. This would then be combined together to form <script> tag again and run.
