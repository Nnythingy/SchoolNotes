Please provide an explanation about how you construct your solution (the program name):


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart1)
user_details.uid at 0x0805c800 which can be found by print &user_details.uid, must be written to 0 to mimic sudo


- What value(s) did you overwrite? How did you find them? (subpart2)


- Did you meet the problem that addresses inside/outside GDB are different? Is that a problem or how did you overcome it?


- Other comments:  
To debug sudo using gdb, there is a need to set the setuid bit for gdb using chmod
