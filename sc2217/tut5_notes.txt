making connections 


making rs btwn gender norms / identity
- identify readings that analyse rs btwn gender norms and mobility 
- 2 ways rs (gender norms > migrations/mobility and vice versa)
    - types of migration / labour possible
    - lived experiences as migrants

- what eg is the reading using as empirical evidence and the argument?

- mobility as
:travellor
:domestic worker FDW
:FW
:refugee
:foreign talent


how long can go away for mmigration (depends on household - kids? family?)
- spouse matters (controlling remittances, safety?, nature?, value?, status?)

state() - identity dispensing role
state() - in shaping discourse around migrants
state() - in brokering FDW

what roles do states play in the gendering of labour markets?
