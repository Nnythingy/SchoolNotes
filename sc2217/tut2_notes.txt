analysis/thoughts:
- core conflict that families want to send them away but still want them to stay (lonelyness)
- sense of loss
    - loss of family / household
        - even the house is breaking down as if the house is a character can feel the loss too
    - even loss of farmers
- anger at authorities?
    - created a hierachy and structure that the locals are helpless, perpetuate the feeling like migrating is the only way
- the film is in the context of difficult agrainian life but is just of one example of rural migration
    - many macroeconomic forces which makes rural life so difficult
    - and in this context this makes their life in agriculture is very undesirable
- does desire to leave affect any gender aspirations/norms?
- material culture signal different gender expectations?
    - men are "heroes" for leaving and women are not
    - also the luxurious lifestyle after coming back
- desires/motivations
- difference between the 2 man
    - one man desire is to leave cause farming is bad (money)
    - other one is for the status
    - models of successful young man - are these migrants
    - the agricultural man is the one that failed
    - the one that already has a proper job is the one that successfully migrate (so technically he doesnt need the $)
- resources necessary to migrate
    - assets required (selling land)
    - english
- expectations after migrating very different
    - but he still enjoys life there
- film plays with our expectations
    - the guy that is about to leave soooo excited
    - but just before/after we know that the other guy did not able to achieve his dream and became a labourour
- globalisation
    - sets expectations of migrating as very desirable
    - creates the issues with agriculture industry
    - alot talk about US and Canada but not UK etc...
- but the mother and daughter reject migration
    - "america cannot give them anything more"
    - women treasure family/kinship so much more
    - as compared to the men who treasure that status of "hero"
    - the daughter also has the shifting attitude to not allow migration to happen
- migration playing a part in shaping gender norms
    - the mother will give inheritance to the daughter (radical idea)
    - in this society, inheritance is very unequal, favouring the men much more
        - pateralinear heteropatrichail society
        - women not expected to get anything
- perspectives who we want to hear
    - the son (life good there? why did he left)
    - the little kid (is he socialised into this aspiration)(his definition of success)
    - any other migrants to share if they face any difficulties overseas
- inequities between migrants
    - based on their knowledge of english
- what is the narrative should be encouraged? or should we encourage a certain narrative even?
    - are a certain type of dream even good/promoted
- relationship between transnational migration and impact on society
    - and even on the future
        - 
    - cannot think abt it as a either migrate or dont migrate at all mentality (not just whether they have enough opportunities locally)
        - but also types of migrations pathway
        - comparison of migration is other types of migration and not only no migration

- migrations reproduces inequities (bring forward inequities that stem from those that they already have)
- migration restructure inequities




film - sent away boys (2016) harjant gill
- global migration away from rural Punjab happening even tho the land is fertile
    - reasons for migration
- eldest was educated and suddenly ran away?? disappeared - never came back from work
- 2nd died young
- youngest married and left to america with in-laws
- sons all left and only left parent alone
    - but his dreams of being a distinguised farmer cannot happen
    - from landlord to a truck driver like a labourour which feels like a decrease in status
- overseas the people there might also have a short life
- only daughter doesnt want her own son to go

- "man and animal are the same" in india
- college man dreams to emigrate for better prospects and they do not see future back in india
    - prices to buy raw materials higher than their selling price
    - 50/60s farming crisis in india (green revolution not really useful)
    - reaching a large nation needs money and connection
    - those that grow poor go to smaller nations
    - those that grow rich go to larger nations
- those that illegally migrate - travel through tough conditions are considered local hereos
many songs and film about going abroad

- very obvious difference between returning migrants and locals are very different
- their entire identity/fashion style all different

- centered along male migration in the long past (arnd ww2)
    - to help to reconstruct britain as labour migrants

- family trying to get young man out of Punjab
    - either become militants or target of military operations
    - young man they themselves are in danger
    - at the same time they are a threat to the family

- younger men now trying to join gangs
    - "up to no good if they stay - better if they leave"
    - future so uncertain their lives in limbo are dangerous
    - thus there is an absence of young man
        - the household is now very different (meaning is different now)
    - no longer have vast lands for agriculture
    - now alot of houses/mansions where alot of money to build but no one stays and become ruins

- The importance of knowing English to leave
    - colonised last time but free now - so why is english still controlling them

- migrants are stuck in jobs which will be the first to go in a globalised/digitalised world

- easy to sever bonds
- when we stop caring, we become strangers to ourselves
- success is just living abroad and working doesnt matter what

- the women in the village suffer as the men leave??
