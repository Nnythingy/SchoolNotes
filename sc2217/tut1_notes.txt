- migrants workers in singapore
    - their rights are determined heavily by their conditions of stay?
    - the body who "governs" them would be the MOM
    (states can control their terms for migrants workers almost comletely)
        - can debate on the ethics/conditions
        - but everything still rely on the soverign authority to grant these foreign labour
        - remedy of this situation furthers the power of the state (as we are asking them to solve)
        - migrants will not be protected by their own state when they are in the new country (anything eg:punishments, would be given only when back to the own country)
    - structural difference in treating migrants (want the high skilled migrants to become a citizen 
        and want low skilled migrants to only be transient)
        - gendered control even for both transient/permament migrants (female domestic workers cannot be pregnant)

- Know the difference between micro (individual experience/desire/storires)
and the macro (structural things from higher up that can explain things)
- interplay between micro and macro
    - understand how skill determines the value of the migrant?
    - value is relational**
    - comparing / listing passport strength as compared to other countries
        - this creates the value (something must be devalued for other things to be valued)

- changes in identity (Yale NUS cards no longer can used) - institutional transition while the powers/authorities/bigger structures have yet to figure out how to change [stop gap versions]
    - the macro changes and how it affects the micro decisions and alot of details (how does cards look etc)
- responsibilities that come with the identification

- using multiple identities to prove certain details true by virtue of it being same in these different documents

- family as an entity of control (authorisation of movement via the family)

- refugee documentation


- narrowing on types of identification (last time there are much more fluid id for very specific uses)

- social norms (can contradict state norms) - and power it has across multiple domains ie: needing a drivers license to drive


- lack of state authority does not mean no authority (must think about the plularity of (hegemonic) sources of authority)



- locuts videos
    - comedic effect? (dramatisising of locusts as illegal immigrants) = tiktoks
    - how india treats refugees as insects - since this video was editted by someone else to give this slant
    - locusts issue used as a political issue (dont even know where its from)

think of human animal relations
