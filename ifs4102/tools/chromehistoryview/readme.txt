Description
===========

ChromeHistoryView is a small utility that reads the history data file of
Google Chrome Web browser, and displays the list of all visited Web pages
in the last days. For each visited Web page, the following information is
displayed: URL, Title, Visit Date/Time, Number of visits, number of times
that the user typed this address (Typed Count), Referrer, and Visit ID.
You can select one or more history items, and them export them into
html/xml/csv/text file, or copy the information to the clipboard and
paste it into Excel.

You can also use this tool to read the history of other Chromium-based
Web browsers, like Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and others...
