This question is automatically graded by a bot.

We found the binary executable for `mastermind`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

Your `mastermind` passes all test cases. :thumbsup:

Your `mastermind` seems to have a memory leak.  There is a -1 penalty for not freeing memory that is allocated on the heap.  Please make sure any memory that you asked for are returned back after you are done.  It's polite to do so!

Your `mmnull` crashes if memory allocation on the heap fails.  There is a -1 penalty for failing to guard against memory allocation failure.  Please remember to check for NULL.

`clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `mastermind.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:

No documentation-related warnings are generated.
