# peak
This question is jointly graded by a bot and a tutor.

We found the binary executable for `peak`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

* Your `peak` fails to pass 1 of the test cases.  For this question, there is a -1 penalty for each failed test.
* No memory leaks detected.  Great!
* Your solution has a invalid memory read.  -1.  You should only read from memory locations you have access to.
* No invalid memory write detected.
* Your program crashes if memory allocation on the heap fails.  There is a -1 penalty for failing to guard against memory allocation failure.  Please remember to check for NULL.
* `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `peak.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:
* No documentation-related warnings are generated. 

Based on the efficiency of your code as determined by your tutor, the maximum marks for correctness is 10.
