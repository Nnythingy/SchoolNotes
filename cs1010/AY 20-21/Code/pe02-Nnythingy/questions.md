CS1010 Practical Exam II 20/21 Semester 1
-----------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES

1. This assessment paper contains 5 questions.

2. The total marks for this assessment is 45. Answer ALL
   questions.

3. This is an OPEN BOOK assessment.  You are only allowed to
   refer to written/printed notes.  No online resources/digital
   documents are allowed, except those accessible from the PE
   nodes (peXXX.comp.nus.edu.sg) (e.g., man pages are allowed).

4. You can assume that all the given inputs are valid.

5. You can assume that the types `long` and `double` suffice for
   storing integer values and real values respectively, for the
   purpose of this examination.

6. You should see the following in your home directory:

   - The skeleton code tictactoe.c, sun.c, replace.c,
     soil.c and substring.c
   - A file named Makefile to automate compilation and
     testing
   - A file named test.sh to invoke the program with its
     test cases
   - Two directories, inputs and outputs, within which you
     can find some sample inputs and outputs
   - `compile_flags.txt` which contains the compilation flags.

7. You can run the command `make` to automatically compile and
   (if compiled successfully) run the tests.

8. Solve the given programming tasks by editing the given
   skeleton code. You can leave the files in your home
   directory and log off after the asssessment is over. There
   is no need to submit your code.

9. Only the code written in tictactoe.c, sun.c, replace.c,
   soil.c, and substring.c directly under your home directory
   will be graded. Make sure that you write your solution in
   the correct file.

10. Marking criteria are (i) correctness, (ii) style, (iii) 
    efficiency, (iv) documentation, and (v) memory management.  
    Mark allocation to these criteria differs from question
    to question.  Read `questions.md` for the requirement of
    each question.

11. Note that correctness is defined in the broad sense of
    using the various programming constructs in C (type,
    function, variable, loops, conditionals, arithmetic
    expressions, logical expressions) properly â€“ not just
    producing the correct output.

12. You should write code that is clean, neat, and readable
    to get the mark allocated to style.

# Question 1: TicTacToe (6 Marks)
---------------------------------
The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is typically played on a game board
that consists of a 3-by-3 grid.  Two players called X and O,
take turns to mark each grid cell with X and O respectively.
Player X wins if they put X in either an entire column, an
entire row, or in the entire of either of the two diagonals
on the game board.  Similarly, Player O wins if she put O
in either an entire column, an entire row, or in the entire 
of either of the two diagonals on the game board.

Write a program `tictactoe` that reads in a Tic-Tac-Toe
board from the standard input.  The board is represented by
three lines of text, each with three characters consisting
of either `X`, `O` or `?`.  `?` indicates that the cell is
empty and has not been marked by either player yet.  You can
assume that the board represents a valid Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Your program must determine if the game has ended and there
is already the winner, given the game board.  If there is a
winner, print out the winner (X or O).  Otherwise, print out
the string "no winner".  You can assume that there is at
most one winner.

Your program must contain a boolean function called
`has_won` that takes in the game board and a player, and
returns whether the given player has won.

## Sample Run

## Marking Scheme
-----------------

- Style: 1 marks
- Correctness: 3 marks
- Efficiency: 0 marks
- Documentation: 2 marks

Efficiency: No marks is allocated for efficiency.  Your code
is expected to run in O(1) time.  We may deduct marks if
your implementation perform obvious redundant or duplicated
work.

Documentation: You should document every function in this
question according to the CS1010 documentation requirement
using the Doxygen format.

# Question 2: Sun (6 Marks)
---------------------------

A prime number is a positive integer larger than 1 that is
divisible only by 1 and itself.

A triangular number is a number of the form x(x+1)/2, where
x is a positive integer.  The first few triangular numbers
are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15.  There are O(sqrt(n)) triangular
numbers smaller than n.

Wei-Zhi Sun, a mathematician, has conjectured in 2008 that,
any positive integer, except 216, can be expressed as p + t,
where p is either 0 or a prime number, and t is either 0 or
a triangular number.

Write a program `sun` that, reads in a positive integer n,
and print all possible pairs of p and t, in increasing order
of p, such that p + t = n.  If no such pairs can be found,
print nothing.

## Sample Run
-------------
```
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./sun

0 10
7 3
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./sun
18
3 15
17 1
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./sun
216
```

## Marking Scheme
-----------------

- Style: 1 marks
- Correctness: 2 marks
- Efficiency: 3 marks
- Documentation: 0 marks

Efficiency: Your code should run in O(n) time.  In addition,
we will deduct marks if your code has obvious redundant or
duplicated work.  Your code must be correct or almost correct
to receive the efficiency marks.

Documentation: You do not have to write Doxygen
documentation for each function.  You are still encouraged
to comment on your code to help the grader understand your
intention.

# Question 3: Replace (11 Marks)
-------------------------------

Given a string, we wish to repeatedly perform the search and
replace operation on the string.  In each search-and-replace
operation, we wish to replace all occurrences of a target
substring with another replacement substring.

For instance, given the string `engineering`, if we replace
the target `in` with the replacement `er`, we will end up
with the string `engereererg`.  Next, if we replace `ere`
with `O`, we get `engOOrg`.

The replacement happens by scanning the input string left to
right.  Each occurrence is replaced in sequence.  For
instance,  if we replace the occurrences `aa` in the input
`aaaa` with `b`, the output is `bb`.

You can assume that the target substring to replace is either
longer or equal to the length of the replacement.

Write a program `replace` that performs a sequence of
search-and-replace operation on an input string.

The input of the program is as follows:

- The first line contains the string s to be operated on.
  You can assume that the input string does not contain white
  spaces.  

- The second line contains a positive integer k,
  which is the number of search-and-replace operations.  

- In the next k lines, each line contains two strings, s1 
  and s2, with the length of s2 <= length of s1.

The output of the program is a single line containing the
output string.

CONSTRAINT: You are not allowed to call methods from the C
string library, except `strlen`.

## Sample Run
-------------
```
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./replace
aaaa
1
aa b
bb
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./replace
engineering
2
in er
ere O
engOOrg
```

## Marking Scheme
-----------------

- Style: 1 marks
- Correctness: 5 marks
- Memory Management: 3 marks
- Efficiency: 2 marks
- Documentation: 0 marks

Memory Management: To obtain full marks for memory
management, make sure that your code does not have memory
leaks, even if memory allocation fails.

Efficiency: To obtain full marks for efficiency, your code
only needs to run in O(nk) times for each search-and-replace
operation, where n is the length of the input string, and k
is the length of the target string.  Your code must be
correct or almost correct to receive the efficiency marks.

If your search-and-replace runs faster than O(nk) and is 
correct, we will give you 2 bonus marks for efficiency.

Documentation: You do not have to write Doxygen documentation 
for each function.  You are still encouraged to comment on 
your code to help the grader understand your intention.

# Question 4: Soil (11 Marks)
-----------------------------

In the farm owns by Old McDonald, a plot of land is divided
into a grid of m-by-n cells.  Old McDonald has hired you to
look for a cell with the perfect soil salinity level to
plant his crops.  Armed with a salinity meter, you planned
to check each of the m x n cell one-by-one, to find the cell
with the right salinity level.

Just as you were about to start, Old McDonald pointed to a
map of the grid and said, "There is something perculiar
about this plot of land.  If you walk through the cells
row-by-row, from left to right, the soil salinity increases.
If you walk column-by-coltmn, from top to bottom, the
salinity level increases.  Further, no two cells have the
same salinity level."

"Perfect," you said, "Now I only need to check O(m + n) of
the cells instead of every cell, which would take O(mn)
time!"

Write a program `soil` to simulate the process to search for
salinity levels in a plot of land, by searching for a given
integer in a 2D array of integers.  Your program must read
the following from the standard input.

The first line contains three positive integers, m, n, and k.  
m and n represent the number of rows and columns of the 2D 
array, and k represents the number of queries.

The next m rows in the input contain the values to be stored
in the 2D array.  Each row has n integers.  The following
properties are guaranteed in the 2D array:

- In each row, the integers are in strictly increasing order
- In each column, the integers are in strictly increasing order
- The integers are unique in the 2D array.

The next k values represent the queries, i.e., the integers
to search for.  For each query, your program should look for
it in the given 2D array, and either

- print the row and column indices of the 2D array that
  contains the value, separated by space, on its own line, 

- or print the string "not found" if the corresponding 
  value cannot be found.

## Example
----------
The following is a valid input 2D array:

```
1 4 8
2 5 9
3 7 10
```

Each row is sorted in increasing order from left to right,
and each column is sorted in increasing order from top t
bottom.

If the query to search for is 5, the program should print 
"1 1".  If the query is 6, the program should print 
"not found".

## Sample Run
-------------
```
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./soil
3 3 4
1 4 8
2 5 9
3 7 10
1
5
6
10
0 0
1 1
not found
2 2
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./soil
5 5 1
1  2  11 16 26
3  4  12 17 27
5  6  13 18 28
7  8  14 19 29
10 15 20 25 30
9
not found
```

## Marking Scheme
-----------------

- Style: 1 marks
- Memory Management: 1 marks
- Correctness: 3 marks
- Efficiency: 6 marks
- Documentation: 0 marks

Memory Management: You do not have to handle the case where
memory allocation fails, but you should still ensure that
your program does not have any memory leaks if it completes
successfully.

Efficiency: Your algorithm must take O(m + n) times to
search a given query to obtain full marks.  An O(mn)
solution is trivial and will receive 0 marks for efficiency.
Any solution slower than O(m + n) but faster than O(mn) will
receive partial marks for efficiency.  Your solution must be
correct or almost correct to receive the efficiency mark.

Documentation: You do not have to write Doxygen
documentation for each function.  You are still encouraged
to comment on your code to help the grader understand your
intention.

# Question 5: Substring (11 Marks)
----------------------------------

Given a string, print all possible substrings of length k of
the string.

The order in which the substrings are printed is defined as
follows.  Let s be in the input string; x and y be two
substrings of s.  Suppose that x[i] and y[i] is the first
character that the substrings differ.  If x[i] appears
before y[i] in s, then x should be printed before y.

For instance, if k = 4 and the input is singa, the output
should be

sing
sina
siga
snga
inga

Write a program `substring` that reads in a string s
followed by a positive integer k from the standard input.
You can assume that s contains only lower case letters 'a'
to 'z' with no repetition and k is at most the length of s.

The program should print to the standard output, all
possible substring of s of length k in the order defined
above, one substring per line.

## Sample Run
-------------
```
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./substring
singa 4
sing
sina
siga
snga
inga
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./substring
numbers 7
numbers
ooiwt@pe101:~/$ ./substring
done 1

```

## Marking Scheme
-----------------

- Style: 1 marks
- Memory Management: 1 marks
- Correctness: 9 marks
- Efficiency: 0 marks
- Documentation: 0 marks

Memory Management: You do not have to handle the case where
memory allocation fails, but you should still ensure that
your program does not have any memory leaks if it completes
successfully.

Efficiency: There is no requirement for the running time of
your algorithm.  We may, however, still deduct marks if your
code has obvious redundant or duplicated work.

Documentation: You do not have to write Doxygen
documentation for each function.  You are still encouraged
to comment on your code to help the grader understand your
intention.
