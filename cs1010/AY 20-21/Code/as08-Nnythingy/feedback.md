# walk
This question is automatically graded by a bot.

We found the binary executable for `walk`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

* Your solution fails to pass medium size cases.  It is likely that your code suffers from integer overflows.  Further, there is no efficiency mark if the program is not correct.
* No memory leaks detected.  Great!
* No invalid memory read detected.
* No invalid memory write detected.
* `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `walk.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:
* No documentation-related warnings are generated.

# maze
This question is jointly graded by a bot and a tutor.

We found the binary executable for `maze`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.


The tutor has marked your code.  You can find [the comments from your tutor here](https://github.com/nus-cs1010-2021-s1/as08-Nnythingy/commit/6fdb45fe01a6014141825f0d3d5bbbf89b2194f2).

Deduction by tutor: 2 (correctness), 0 (efficiency), 0 (documentation), 0 (style).

Output from the bot:

* No memory leaks detected.  Great!
* No invalid memory read detected.
* No invalid memory write detected.
* Your program seems to survive even when memory allocation fails.  Good.
* `clang` and `clang-tidy` generate 1 (non-documentation-related) warnings for `maze.c`.  There is a -1 penalty per warning.
* No documentation-related warnings are generated.
