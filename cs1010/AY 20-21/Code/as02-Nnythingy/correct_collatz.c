/**
 * CS1010 Semester 1 AY20/21
 * Assignment 2: Collatz 
 *
 * Read in a positive integer n from the standard input,
 * then, for each number k between number 1 .. n, transform
 * it into 1 based on the steps below:
 * - if k is even, k = k/2
 * - else, k = 3k + 1
 * Find the number k that requires the most number of steps
 * between 1 and n, and print both k and the number of steps
 * to standard output. If there are multiple numbers with
 * the same number of steps, we prefer to output the larger
 * among these numbers.
