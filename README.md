# SchoolNotes #

Hi! These are the study materials I have used when taking these mods.
1. Do note that most of the materials are **not** created by me, and are created by the professors themselves or other students.
2. Some PDFs might have my own annotations/notes, these are usually done and added via adobe pdf reader and should be able to be deleted.
3. Solutions to questions and assignments are uploaded if they were released, else my own solutions will be uploaded instead, do note that they might not be correct.
4. Do also take note that AY20/21 had assessments mainly online, thus might not include a question paper.
5. My grades for each mod are added at the bottom as disclosure as some mods might not be my strengths and hence any notes and submissions might not be as accurate.
