# SchoolNotes #

Hi! These are the study materials I have used when taking these mods.
1. Do note that most of the materials are **not** created by me, and are created by the professors or other students.
2. Some PDFs might have my own annotations/notes, these are usually done and added via adobe pdf reader and should be able to be deleted if you download.
3. Solutions to questions and assignments are uploaded if they were released, else my own solutions will be uploaded (sometimes), do note that they might not be correct.
4. Do also take note that AY20/21 had assessments mainly online, thus might not include a question paper.
5. Any notes and submissions are just my own intepretation and may be wrong. Hence please check through.
