// request_for_table() should call this function exactly once,

// Your implementation must guarantee that, given two groups (i.e. threads), A and B:
// - If A calls on_enqueue() before B calls request_for_table(),
//   then A must queue up before B in the queue.
// (Note: When we talk about the time a group calls a function,
// we mean the time where control flow _enters_ the function.)

// This function is called by the main driver when a group that is
// currently seated leaves the restaurant.  The pointer `state`
// points to the same object given to `request_for_table()`,
// so you may use this object to retrieve any information you require.
